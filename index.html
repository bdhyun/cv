          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I am a self-taught web developer. This endeavor started as a personal challenge to learn something new. However, what started as a challenge gradually morphed into a desire to start on a new career path in tech! Talk about planting a seed! Hopefully, I can bear the fruits of this seed by becoming a hired developer.</p>

          <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
          <p>From web design to user experience, I am passionate about <em>learning how</em> to solve problems efficiently and create solutions that are intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. Understanding that everything is a work-in-progress keeps me grounded in developing myself as a design-oriented developer and as an individual.</p>

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>Among other things, taking and editing photos is one of my hobbies. I wouldn't call it a necessary condition to my existence, but it's pretty close to it. And, the reason why I enjoy it so much is because it's a paradox of a sport--in the Old English sense. The click of the shutter doesn't justify the considerations taken prior to the shot--thoughts on the composition, lighting, settings, and proposed meaning. It's a fickle sport that forces you to act quickly yet intently. But, I digress. Although my passion exceeds my talents, I invite you to check out some of my photos on Instagram!</p>
